# Welcome the Class of 2019-2020 Repository

This repository will be used to demonstrate that students have met competencies for the Array Full-stack Web Development Apprenticeship program.

The repository is organized by subject area and each directory contains a README.md file with instructions for submitting course work.

The root of this repository now contains two new shell scripts to help students get out of trouble. The commands below must be run from the root directory (e.g. class-fullstack-19-20) The command are are:

1. `.bin/avoid-trouble` will execute a pull and pass the merge strategy 'theirs' to the pull. This can be done to make sure you don't have merge conflicts and can only be run on the submission branch. You will get an error if you try to run in on the master branch.
2. `.bin/resolve-all-conflicts` will resolve all merge conflicts using the 'theirs' strategy. This can be run if you find your self already in a conflicted state.
