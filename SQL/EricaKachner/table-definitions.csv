Table Name,Table Type,Entity Description,Purpose
Employees,Regular,"The people, a combination of managers and apprentices, who work for the company on the projects commissioned by the clientelle. ","It is important for the employees to track their project time for accurate billing of the clients. The role of the employee is differentiated here as an employee can either be a manager or an apprentice. Only managers and apprentices have access to the hours, therefore the permissions to access that information reside within this table in addition with their contact information. "
Managers,Extension,The project employees who oversee the apprentices and provide the instructional time to train them.,Managers have their own hire and termination dates for the sake of Human Resource data tracking if in case they were a prior apprentice themselves.  Since they oversee multiple apprentices they have a one-to-many relationship with their apprentices. 
Apprentices,Extension,The project employees who gain oversight from the employee managers.  They can either track instruction time or project time.,This table is vital to keep a separate time tracker for the instructional time the apprentices gain as this will help them advance through the stages of their apprenticeship program. They are linked with their manager in a one-to-one relationship. They also have their own hire and termination dates in case they graduate from their apprenticeship program and are invited on by the company to become a manager. This way the information tracked will differentiate their title as either an apprentice or a manager while maintaining the same employee id. 
Employee_Projects,Junction ,"This table serves as the midway point between tables ""Employees"" and ""Projects"" since the relationship between the two is a many-to-many.","Since the breakdown of a many-to-many relationship consists of two one-to-many relationships, this is the intersection enabling the one-to-many aspect extending to both tables. "
Projects,Regular,The purpose of the company is to carry out these very commisioned tasks in which the clients of the company approach them for completion.  ,"The information within this table is important to maintain the details of the project, name, date and time tracking, contact information and the company team working on each and any of the projects at any given time. "
Clients,Regular,The people and organizations who commission the company to build different products for them. ,The clientelle information is important to help keep track of the projects with a brief description of the project and the address information since this is where the billing information will be sent to. It is because of the clients that the projects exist in the first place. 
Address,MultiPart,The location at which the billing invoices will get sent to.,This table serves as a multi-value table for the sake of simplicity. It also helps later on to be able to differentiate between the validation of the states.
State,Validation,The provinces in which each separarate governing body reside. ,"Since there are 50 United States, they each can either be spelled out in full, or abbreviated with their state initials. This table allows for whichever version of the state to be entered and the input will be represented as the primay key in the ""Address"" table using initials."
Point Of Contact,Regular,The liason between the clients and the project employees. (Point of Contact),They are important since final decisions and fine details will be relayed through these entities ensuring the overall project is the best representation of the company. Their contact information is included here along with a tie to the clients in which they represent. 
Time Entries,Regular,The timestamps for which an employee begins and ends either a project or a period of instruction. ,"The time tracking aspect is the primary purposing of this database system as it provides both the instructional time for apprentices so they know when they can anticipate a performance review and also so they know when they have met the minimum time requirements for the government program. This also tracks project time so the clients can be invoiced with fair, accurate and very objective billing standards. "
